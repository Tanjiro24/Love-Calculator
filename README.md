Love Calculator:

A Love Calculator is a fun web application that estimates compatibility between two names based on a playful algorithm. Using HTML, you design the input fields for entering names and a button to calculate. CSS adds styling to make the app visually attractive, creating a romantic or playful theme. JavaScript processes the inputs, applies the algorithm, and dynamically displays a percentage or result, adding interactivity and an entertaining touch to the experience.
